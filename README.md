### Overview

The Sequence library is a leaner alternative to sequential Java 8 Streams, used in similar ways but with a lighter step,
and with better integration with the rest of Java.

It aims to be roughly feature complete with sequential `Streams`, with additional convenience methods for advanced
traversal and transformation. In particular it allows easier collecting into common `Collections` without `Collectors`,
better handling of `Maps` with `Map.Entry` as first-class citizens, tighter integration with the rest of Java by being
implemented in terms of `Iterable`, advanced partitioning, mapping and filtering methods, for example allowing you to
peek at previous or next elements to make decisions during traversal. `Sequences` go to great lengths to be as lazy and
late-evaluating as possible, with minimal overhead.

`Sequences` use Java 8 lambdas in much the same way as `Streams` do, but is based on readily available `Iterables`
instead of a black box pipeline, and is built for convenience and compatibility with the rest of Java. It's
for programmers wanting to perform common data processing tasks on moderately sized collections. If you need parallel
iteration or are processing over 1 million or so entries, you might benefit from using a parallel `Stream` instead.

```Java
List<String> evens = Sequence.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
                             .filter(x -> x % 2 == 0)
                             .map(Object::toString)
                             .toList();

assertThat(evens, contains("2", "4", "6", "8"));
```

### Usage

#### Iterable

Because each `Sequence` is an `Iterable` you can re-use them safely after you have already traversed them, as long as
they're backed by an `Iterable`, `Collection`, array or generated sequence, not an `Iterator` or `Stream` which can
only be traversed once.

```Java
Sequence<Integer> singulars = Sequence.range(1, 9); // Digits 1..9

// using sequence of ints 1..9 first time to get odd numbers between 1 and 9
Sequence<Integer> odds = singulars.step(2);
assertThat(odds, contains(1, 3, 5, 7, 9));

// re-using the same sequence again to get squares of numbers between 4 and 8
Sequence<Integer> squares = singulars.startingAt(4).endingAt(8).map(i -> i * i);
assertThat(squares, contains(16, 25, 36, 49, 64));
```

Also because each `Sequence` is an `Iterable` they work beautifully in foreach loops:

```Java
Sequence<Integer> sequence = Sequence.ints().limit(5);

int x = 1;
for (int i : sequence)
    assertThat(i, is(x++));

assertThat(x, is(6));
```

Because `Sequence` is a `@FunctionalInterface` requiring only the `iterator()` method of `Iterable` to be implemented,
it's very easy to create your own full-fledged `Sequence` instances that can be operated on like any other `Sequence`
through the default methods on the interface that carry the bulk of the burden.

```Java
List<Integer> list = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Sequence as @FunctionalInterface of list's Iterator
Sequence<Integer> sequence = list::iterator;

// Operate on sequence as any other sequence using default methods
Sequence<String> transformed = sequence.map(Object::toString);

assertThat(transformed.limit(3), contains("1", "2", "3"));
```

Sequences can be created from `Iterators` or `Streams` but can then only be passed over once.

```
Iterator<Integer> iterator = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).iterator();

Sequence<Integer> sequence = Sequence.from(iterator);

assertThat(sequence, contains(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
assertThat(sequence, is(emptyIterable()));
```

If you have an `Iterator` or `Stream` and wish to convert it to a full-fledged multi-iterable `Sequence`, use the
caching methods on `Sequence`.

```
Iterator<Integer> iterator = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).iterator();

Sequence<Integer> sequence = Sequence.cache(iterator);

assertThat(sequence, contains(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
assertThat(sequence, contains(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
```

#### Updating

`Sequences` have full support for updating the underlying collection where possible, both through `Iterator#remove()`
and by modifying the underlying collection directly in between iterations.

```Java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));

Sequence.from(list).filter(x -> x % 2 != 0).removeAll();

assertThat(list, contains(2, 4));
```

```Java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));

Sequence<Integer> sequence = Sequence.from(list);
assertThat(sequence, contains(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));

list.add(6);
assertThat(sequence, contains(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6));
```

#### Streams

`Sequences` interoperate beautifully with `Stream`, through the expected `from(Stream)` and `.stream()` methods.

```Java
Stream<String> abcd = List.of("a", "b", "c", "d").stream();
Stream<String> abbccd = Sequence.from(abcd).pairs().<String>flatten().stream();

assertThat(abbccd.collect(Collectors.toList()), contains("a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "d"));
```

#### Recursion

There is full support for infinite recursive `Sequences`, including termination at a known value.

```Java
Sequence<Integer> fibonacci = Sequence.recurse(Pair.of(0, 1), p -> p.shiftLeft(p.apply(Integer::sum)))
                                      .map(Pair::getLeft)
                                      .endingAt(34);

assertThat(fibonacci, contains(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34));
```

```Java
Exception e = new IllegalStateException(new IllegalArgumentException(new NullPointerException()));

Sequence<Throwable> sequence = Sequence.recurse(e, Throwable::getCause).untilNull();

assertThat(sequence,
           contains(instanceOf(IllegalStateException.class), instanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class),
                    instanceOf(NullPointerException.class)));
```

#### Reduction

The standard reduction operations are available as per `Stream`:

```Java
Sequence<Long> thirteen = Sequence.longs().limit(13);
long factorial = thirteen.reduce(1L, (r, i) -> r * i);

assertThat(factorial, is(6227020800L));
```

#### Maps

`Maps` are handled as `Sequences` of `Entry`, with special transformation methods that convert to/from `Maps`.

```Java
Sequence<Integer> keys = Sequence.of(1, 2, 3);
Sequence<String> values = Sequence.of("1", "2", "3");

Sequence<Pair<Integer, String>> keyValueSequence = keys.interleave(values);
Map<Integer, String> map = keyValueSequence.toMap();

assertThat(map, is(equalTo(Maps.builder(1, "1").put(2, "2").put(3, "3").build())));
```

You can also map `Entry` `Sequences` to `Pairs` which allows more expressive transformation and filtering.

```Java
Map<String, Integer> map = Maps.builder("1", 1).put("2", 2).put("3", 3).put("4", 4).build();

Sequence<Pair<String, Integer>> sequence = Sequence.from(map)
                                                   .map(Pair::from)
                                                   .filter(p -> p.test((s, i) -> i != 2))
                                                   .map(p -> p.map((s, i) -> Pair.of(s + " x 2", i * 2)));

assertThat(sequence.toMap(), is(equalTo(Maps.builder("1 x 2", 2).put("3 x 2", 6).put("4 x 2", 8).build())));
```

You can also work directly on `Entry` keys and values using `EntrySequence`.

```Java
Map<String, Integer> original = Maps.builder("1", 1).put("2", 2).put("3", 3).put("4", 4).build();

EntrySequence<Integer, String> oddsInverted = EntrySequence.from(original)
                                                           .filter((k, v) -> v % 2 != 0)
                                                           .map((k, v) -> Maps.entry(v, k));

assertThat(oddsInverted.toMap(), is(equalTo(Maps.builder(1, "1").put(3, "3").build())));
```

#### Pairs

When iterating over sequences of `Pairs` of item, `BiSequence` provides native operators and transformations:

```Java
BiSequence<String, Integer> presidents = BiSequence.ofPairs("Abraham Lincoln", 1861, "Richard Nixon", 1969,
                                                            "George Bush", 2001, "Barack Obama", 2005);

Sequence<String> joinedOffice = presidents.toSequence((n, y) -> n + " (" + y + ")");

assertThat(joinedOffice, contains("Abraham Lincoln (1861)", "Richard Nixon (1969)", "George Bush (2001)",
                                  "Barack Obama (2005)"));
```

#### Primitive

There are also primitive versions of `Sequence` for `char`, `int`, `long` and `double` processing: `CharSeq`,
`IntSequence`, `LongSequence` and `DoubleSequence`.

```Java
CharSeq snakeCase = CharSeq.from("Hello Lexicon").map(c -> (c == ' ') ? '_' : c).map(Character::toLowerCase);

assertThat(snakeCase.asString(), is("hello_lexicon"));
```

```Java
IntSequence squares = IntSequence.positive().map(i -> i * i);

assertThat(squares.limit(5), contains(1, 4, 9, 16, 25));
```

```Java
LongSequence negativeOdds = LongSequence.negative().step(2);

assertThat(negativeOdds.limit(5), contains(-1L, -3L, -5L, -7L, -9L));
```

```Java
DoubleSequence squareRoots = IntSequence.positive().toDoubles().map(Math::sqrt);

assertThat(squareRoots.limit(3), contains(sqrt(1), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)));
```

#### Peeking

`Sequences` also have mapping and filtering methods that peek on the previous and next elements:

```Java
CharSeq titleCase = CharSeq.from("hello_lexicon")
                           .mapBack('_', (p, c) -> p == '_' ? toUpperCase(c) : c)
                           .map(c -> (c == '_') ? ' ' : c);

assertThat(titleCase.asString(), is("Hello Lexicon"));
```

#### Partitioning

Both regular and primitive `Sequences` have advanced windowing and partitioning methods, allowing you to divide up
`Sequences` in various ways, including a partitioning method that uses a `BiPredicate` to determine which two
elements to create a batch between.

```Java
Sequence<Sequence<Integer>> batched = Sequence.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).batch(3);

assertThat(batched, contains(contains(1, 2, 3), contains(4, 5, 6), contains(7, 8, 9)));
```

```Java
String vowels = "aeoiuy";

Sequence<String> consonantsVowels = CharSeq.from("terrain")
                                           .batch((a, b) -> (vowels.indexOf(a) == -1) !=
                                                            (vowels.indexOf(b) == -1))
                                           .map(CharSeq::asString);

assertThat(consonantsVowels, contains("t", "e", "rr", "ai", "n"));
```
